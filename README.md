## Lasagna Bolognese

 Prepare the Bolognese Meat Sauce

    Make the soffritto:

    Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in sauté pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold.
    Add other ingredients:

    Add the beef, pork, and sausage to the soffritto and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned. Sprinkle with the ground clove, cinnamon, and pepper.
    Add the tomatoes:

    Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.
    Add milk and simmer:

    Add the milk, season with sea salt, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is sticking to the bottom of the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook.

And so on...

## Recipe of a Butter Chicken

Prep:50 mins
Cook:1 hr

### Ingredients :
800g boneless and skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
coriander leaves, finely sliced red onion, sliced green or red chilli, naan bread or basmati rice, and chutney, to serve
### For the marinade
120g Greek yogurt
thumb-sized piece ginger, grated
4-5 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 lemon, juiced
3 tsp mild chilli powder
1 tsp ground cumin
½ tsp garam masala
½ tsp turmeric
### For the sauce
1kg ripe vine or plum tomatoes
thumb-sized piece ginger, peeled, half grated and half finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, crushed
4 green cardamom pods
2 cloves
1 bay leaf
1-2 tsp chilli powder
80g butter, diced
2 green chillies, cut lengthways
75ml single cream, plus a drizzle to serve
5-6 dried fenugreek leaves, crushed between your fingers (optional)
1 tsp garam masala
1 tbsp sugar
For the spiced butter (optional)
3 tbsp ghee (see below) or butter
2 tsp black mustard seeds
1 dried whole Kashmiri chilli
6-8 dried curry leaves

### Method : 
### STEP 1
Mix all of the marinade ingredients together in a large mixing bowl with 1½ tsp salt. Add the chicken pieces and mix together until well-coated, then cover the bowl and chill for 1 hr or overnight in the fridge.

### STEP 2
Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9. Transfer the chicken pieces to a large baking tray (discard any remaining marinade), and cook for 10-15 mins. Turn the pieces after 10 mins so they colour evenly on both sides. The chicken doesn’t need to be completely cooked through at this point as it will cook for a few more mins in the sauce.

### STEP 3
Meanwhile, for the sauce, slice the tomatoes in half and put in a large pan in a single layer with 125ml water, the grated ginger, garlic, cardamom, cloves and bay leaf. Simmer, covered, until the tomatoes have completely disintegrated, about 20-25 mins. Remove the whole spices and blend the tomato mixture with a stick blender, then pass it through a sieve to make a smooth purée. Return to a clean pan, add the chilli powder and simmer for 12-15 mins. It should slowly begin to thicken. When the sauce turns glossy, add the chicken pieces and any of the reserved roasting juices from the tray.

### STEP 4
Slowly stir in the butter, a couple of pieces at a time, and simmer for 6-8 mins until the chicken is cooked through. Add the chopped ginger, green chillies and cream, then simmer for a min or two longer, taking care that the sauce doesn’t split. Stir in 1 tsp salt, fenugreek leaves, if using, and the garam masala, then check the seasoning, adjust if necessary, then add the sugar. In a separate pan, warm all the ingredients for the spiced butter, if using, until the seeds start to pop (see below). Spoon over the curry, scatter with the coriander, onion, chilli, and a drizzle more cream, if using. Serve with naan, pulao rice and chutney.
