Hi My name is Iwo, I come from Poland. About 3 years ago I moved to Germany. I am interested in changing my profession and that's why I started the Web Development course. ​

## Iwo Recipe:

## Lasagna Bolognese

 Prepare the Bolognese Meat Sauce

    Make the soffritto:

    Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in sauté pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold.
    Add other ingredients:

    Add the beef, pork, and sausage to the soffritto and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned. Sprinkle with the ground clove, cinnamon, and pepper.
    Add the tomatoes:

    Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.
    Add milk and simmer:

    Add the milk, season with sea salt, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is sticking to the bottom of the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook.

Make the Béchamel Sauce

And so on...
